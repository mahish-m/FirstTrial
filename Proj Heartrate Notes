Language: Python/android/iOs

Phase 1
	heart rate calculation calculator
	
	input: age
	output: max beats per minute, target heart rate
	calculate: max heart rate/target heart rate

	max heart rate (age)
		return (220 - age)

	*high and low percent are user set - what percentage of max heart rate do you want to check for - default = 70,85*
	target heart rate (resting heart rate, max heart rate(age), low percent, high percent)

	- check for resting heart rate in the morning

	- for target heart rate return both average and range
		- Heart rate resevre = (max heart rate - resting)
		- low range = (Heart rate reserve * low percent) + resting
		- high range = (Heart rate reserve * high percent) + resting
		- average = (high range - low range)/2 + low range
Phase 2
	input: from phone health data, time for update
	output: notif at user specified time for update

	notifications
	at specified time with 
	- met target range or not , what is range
	- met max or not
	- highest bpm + time 

	Phase 1 + better UI
	- sliders
	- color scheme
	- logs on a weekly basis 

Phase 3
	Phase 2 + graph
	graph
	- periodic activity charted , gradient and percent of times that target was met
