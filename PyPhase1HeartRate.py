# #Python Phase 1 Heartrate proj
# hr max - heartrate maximum
# 208-.7(h)
# 65yr old - 163 bpm

# Part 1 -  simple app in ios/android
# which can make the heartrate calculaiton

# Part 2 -  use the age from a wearable app (eg apple health) collected age 

# Part 3 - create graph shows HR max rate 
# if you want to hit your hr max use the graph to see if you are hitting HR max - hourly update, 

#Working Logic: collect age input from user via number entry, 
#collect which output user wants (max heart rate(high end , low end), target heart rate), 
#calculate desired 
#display results
